# Advanced Stale Users Cleanup for Microsoft 365

A comprehensive PowerShell solution for identifying and managing inactive user accounts in Microsoft 365 environments, with enhanced guest lifecycle management and enterprise-grade safety features.

## Overview

This script addresses critical security and compliance challenges in Microsoft 365 by automatically identifying dormant accounts that represent security risks or consume unnecessary licenses. It implements a zero-trust approach for guest accounts while protecting business continuity through intelligent exclusion logic.

## Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance
- **Automated guest lifecycle**: Disable at 180 days, archive at 270 days
- **Regional compliance support**: GDPR, CCPA, and custom retention policies
- **Legal hold detection**: Protects accounts under litigation or compliance holds
- **Service principal detection**: Identifies app-accessed mailboxes to prevent false positives
- **Audit trail**: Comprehensive CSV reports for compliance documentation

### üéØ Intelligent Detection
- **Multi-signal activity tracking**: Azure AD sign-ins, Exchange mailbox access, Teams activity
- **Smart exclusions**: Service accounts, resource mailboxes, system mailboxes
- **Guest sponsor validation**: Identifies orphaned guests with inactive sponsors
- **B2B collaboration detection**: Preserves cross-tenant collaboration accounts
- **Sensitive content protection**: Excludes guests with SharePoint/Purview access

### üöÄ Operational Safety
- **Multi-stage cleanup**: Warning ‚Üí Disable ‚Üí Archive workflow
- **WhatIf support**: Test changes before implementation
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure with detailed logging
- **Parallel processing**: PowerShell 7+ support for faster execution
- **Notification reports**: Ready for mail merge automation

## Prerequisites

- **PowerShell**: Version 5.1 or 7+ (7+ recommended for parallel processing)
- **Required Modules**:
  - Microsoft.Graph
  - ExchangeOnlineManagement (v3+ recommended)
- **Permissions**: See [Required Permissions](#required-permissions) section

## Installation

1. Clone or download the script:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jjrmilner/AdvancedStaleUsersCleanup.git
```

2. Install required modules:
```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Required Permissions

The script uses least-privilege principles and requests only necessary permissions:

### Read-Only Mode (Default)
- User.Read.All
- Directory.Read.All
- AuditLog.Read.All
- Group.Read.All
- Reports.Read.All (optional, for Teams activity)

### Action Mode (-Disable or -ProcessGuests)
Additional permissions:
- User.ReadWrite.All
- Group.ReadWrite.All
- GroupMember.ReadWrite.All

## Usage Examples

### Basic Report (No Changes)
```powershell
.\AdvancedStaleEntraUsersCleanup.ps1
```

### Test What Would Be Disabled
```powershell
.\AdvancedStaleEntraUsersCleanup.ps1 -Disable -WhatIf
```

### Disable Stale Members & Process Guests
```powershell
.\AdvancedStaleEntraUsersCleanup.ps1 -Disable -ProcessGuests
```

### Process Guests with Sensitive Access Protection
```powershell
.\AdvancedStaleEntraUsersCleanup.ps1 -ProcessGuests `
    -SensitiveAccessGroups @('sg-PurviewProtectedContent','sg-ConfidentialAccess')
```

### Test Mode with Limited Users
```powershell
# Process only 10 users for testing
.\AdvancedStaleEntraUsersCleanup.ps1 -MaxUsers 10 -SkipMailboxStats

# Test specific users
.\AdvancedStaleEntraUsersCleanup.ps1 -TestUserUPNs @('user1@domain.com','user2@domain.com')

# Test users with name prefix
.\AdvancedStaleEntraUsersCleanup.ps1 -TestUserFilter 'Test'
```

### Multi-Stage Cleanup with Notifications
```powershell
.\AdvancedStaleEntraUsersCleanup.ps1 -EnableMultiStageCleanup -GenerateNotifications `
    -WarningDays 30 -ProcessGuests
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `CutoffDays` | 180 | Days of inactivity before a member account is considered stale |
| `GuestCutoffDays` | 180 | Days of inactivity before a guest account is disabled |
| `GuestArchiveDays` | 270 | Days of inactivity before a guest account is archived |
| `ArchiveGroupName` | 'sg-ArchivedGuestAccounts' | Security group name for archived guests |
| `ExcludedSkuPatterns` | @('MTR*','PHONESYSTEM_VIRTUALUSER','MCOPSTN*') | License patterns to exclude |
| `SensitiveAccessGroups` | @() | Groups indicating sensitive content access |
| `ServiceAccountPatterns` | @('svc-*','service-*','app-*','sm-*') | Service account name patterns |
| `SystemMailboxPatterns` | @('Billing*','Invoice*','NoReply*','System*') | System mailbox patterns |
| `Disable` | False | Enable member account disabling |
| `ProcessGuests` | False | Enable guest lifecycle processing |
| `SkipSensitiveAccessCheck` | False | Skip SharePoint/Purview access checks |
| `CheckTeamsActivity` | False | Include Teams activity checking |
| `EnableMultiStageCleanup` | False | Use warning periods before actions |
| `GenerateNotifications` | False | Create notification reports |

## Exclusion Logic

The script implements comprehensive exclusion rules to prevent business disruption:

### Member Accounts Excluded When:
- Activity within retention period (configurable by region)
- Directory role member (admin accounts)
- Has excluded license (MTR, phone system, etc.)
- Resource mailbox (room, equipment, shared)
- Has mail forwarding or delegation
- Under litigation or compliance hold
- Mailbox accessed by service principal
- Matches service account patterns
- Mailbox statistics error (requires manual review)

### Guest Accounts Excluded When:
- Activity within guest retention period
- Invitation pending acceptance
- Already archived
- Has sensitive content access
- Active B2B collaboration account
- Guest sponsor is no longer active (flagged for review)

## Output Reports

### Main Report (StaleUsersWithExclusions_[timestamp].csv)
Comprehensive report including:
- User identification details
- All activity timestamps
- License assignments
- Exclusion reasons
- Guest-specific information
- Action recommendations

### Optional Notification Reports
- **GuestSponsorNotifications_[timestamp].csv**: For notifying sponsors about their guests
- **MemberWarnings_[timestamp].csv**: For warning users before disabling accounts

## Guest Lifecycle Management

The script implements a zero-trust approach for external users:
ne
1. **0-179 days**: Active guest period
2. **180-269 days**: Disabled (reversible)
3. **270+ days**: Archived to security group

### Guest-Specific Features:
- Sponsor validation (detects orphaned guests)
- B2B collaboration detection
- Sensitive content access protection
- Acceptance status tracking
- Multi-stage cleanup with warnings

## Safety Features

### Prevents False Positives Through:
- Multiple activity signal checks
- Service principal access detection
- Pattern matching for system accounts
- Error handling with manual review flags
- Regional compliance support

### Business Continuity Protection:
- WhatIf support for testing
- Excludes accounts with dependencies
- Respects legal/compliance holds
- Grace periods for new accounts
- Detailed logging and error reporting

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Reporting**: Run without `-Disable` to review impact
2. **Use WhatIf**: Test with `-WhatIf` before making changes
3. **Schedule Appropriately**:
   - Weekly: Report-only mode
   - Monthly: Member cleanup with `-Disable`
   - Quarterly: Guest lifecycle with `-ProcessGuests`
4. **Define Sensitive Groups**: Use `-SensitiveAccessGroups` for Purview/SharePoint protection
5. **Enable Notifications**: Use `-GenerateNotifications` for automated communications
6. **Monitor Errors**: Review accounts with mailbox statistics errors manually

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Slow Performance**
- Use `-SkipMailboxStats` for faster testing
- Enable PowerShell 7+ for parallel processing
- Use `-MaxUsers` to process in batches

**Permission Errors**
- Ensure you have all required Graph/Exchange permissions
- Check if MFA is required for privileged operations

**Mailbox Statistics Errors**
- Common for archived or migrated mailboxes
- Script flags these for manual review
- Does not disable accounts with stat errors
